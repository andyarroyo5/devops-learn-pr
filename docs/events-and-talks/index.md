| 60,000 tests in 6 min: Create a reliable testing pipeline & deploy safely w/Azure Pipelines | Good test coverage is essential for catching issues before a pull request has been merged, but they have to be the right kind of tests and must be reliable. Sam Guckenheimer digs into the testing transformation his team at Microsoft underwent as they started on their DevOps journey. He explains how they used to test their products and the issues (both technical and cultural) this presented. He walks you through the changes they went through and why and explains the data they found to prove their case for change and what they did to move. Sam also details which things are best covered by unit tests, which you should leave to manual code review in the pull request, and which are best suited to testing in production. | [Video](https://youtu.be/E9ZRZTcPHc4) | [PPT](https://aka.ms/60000tests6mins) |
| Progressive Deployment, Experimentation, Multitenancy, No Downtime, Cloud Security | This experience report is about rearchitecture from a monolith to cloud-native practices. We cover moving stepwise from single tenancy to multitenancy, scaling up to scaling out, fixed resources to optimized variable costs, periodic upgrades to zero-downtime updates, single backlog to continual experimentation, linear to progressive deployment with a controlled blast radius, long release cycles to continual testing, opacity to observability, and pre-release security reports to continuous security practices. Progressive Deployment, Experimentation, Multitenancy, No Downtime, Cloud Security, Oh My! | [Video](https://youtu.be/nGMbR0pRg30) | [PPT](https://aka.ms/devopsarchitecture) |
| DevOps for AI | Because the AI field is young compared to traditional software development, best practices and solutions around life cycle management for these AI systems have yet to solidify. This talk will discuss how we did this at Microsoft in different departments (one of them being Bing). DevOps for AI  | [Video](https://youtu.be/HwZlGQuCTj4) | [PPT](https://aka.ms/devopsforai2018) |
| Evolving Windows: This Journey to DevOps | An overview of the journey Windows has been on to transform its process, tools, and culture to a DevOps model. | [Video](https://youtu.be/SIKX8eEuGAs) | [PPT](https://aka.ms/windowsjourneytodevops) |

We will show you how to deploy to a number of different Azure services, all live and hands on.|Damian Brady,<br/>Abel Wang| 59 |May 2018|
|[Git patterns and anti-patterns for successful developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykZbBD-CmP8)|In this session we show how to use Git in teams with pull requests and how to use branches to manage your releases. In this session we will compare GitHub flow with the 'Release Flow' practised at Microsoft. |Edward Thomson | 20 |May 2018|
|[Building Windows - how the bits flow from check-in to the fast-ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJKV3DJ_-Xg)|Ever wondered how Microsoft takes the combined work of over 11,000 engineers developing  Windows at Microsoft, bring it together in one branch, build, test and get it onto your desktop. Want to know what happens to the telemetry, error reports and bugs that you send and how Microsoft tracks them through to fixes. In this session we'll take you through the VSTS based engineering system used by Windows, talk about the transformation to Agile practises and to Git for version control and talk about what improvements we are hoping to make in the future. |Edward Thomson,<br/>Jill Campbell | 40 | May 2018|

|[Quality in VSTS](https://youtu.be/tj5mfW_gtRU)|Microsoft's decision to move to a single engineering organization, where development and testing are a unified part of the build process rather than separate roles, has helped each person have a greater impact on the quality of the software. Munil Shah shares his first hand experiences.|Munil Shah| 34 | October 2017|
