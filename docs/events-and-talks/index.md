> | 60,000 tests in 6 min: Create a reliable testing pipeline & deploy safely w/Azure Pipelines | Good test coverage is essential for catching issues before a pull request has been merged, but they have to be the right kind of tests and must be reliable. Sam Guckenheimer digs into the testing transformation his team at Microsoft underwent as they started on their DevOps journey. He explains how they used to test their products and the issues (both technical and cultural) this presented. He walks you through the changes they went through and why and explains the data they found to prove their case for change and what they did to move. Sam also details which things are best covered by unit tests, which you should leave to manual code review in the pull request, and which are best suited to testing in production. | [Video](https://youtu.be/E9ZRZTcPHc4) | [PPT](https://aka.ms/60000tests6mins) |
> | Progressive Deployment, Experimentation, Multitenancy, No Downtime, Cloud Security | This experience report is about rearchitecture from a monolith to cloud-native practices. We cover moving stepwise from single tenancy to multitenancy, scaling up to scaling out, fixed resources to optimized variable costs, periodic upgrades to zero-downtime updates, single backlog to continual experimentation, linear to progressive deployment with a controlled blast radius, long release cycles to continual testing, opacity to observability, and pre-release security reports to continuous security practices. Progressive Deployment, Experimentation, Multitenancy, No Downtime, Cloud Security, Oh My! | [Video](https://youtu.be/nGMbR0pRg30) | [PPT](https://aka.ms/devopsarchitecture) |
> | DevOps for AI | Because the AI field is young compared to traditional software development, best practices and solutions around life cycle management for these AI systems have yet to solidify. This talk will discuss how we did this at Microsoft in different departments (one of them being Bing). DevOps for AI  | [Video](https://youtu.be/HwZlGQuCTj4) | [PPT](https://aka.ms/DevOpsForML) |
