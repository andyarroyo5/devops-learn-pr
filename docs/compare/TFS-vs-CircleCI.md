# TFS vs CircleCI
> By: Dave McKinstry

[TFS](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/tfs/), short for Team Foundation Server, is Microsoft's on-premises integrated suite of tools supporting DevOps practices.  It includes capabilities for management and work tracking, version control, CI/CD, package management and manual testing.  In the next major release, TFS will be renamed to Azure DevOps Server to indicate the common codebase and shared functionality with Azure DevOps services.  You can use TFS to host it yourself or Azure DevOps services for a cloud-hosted Software-as-a-Service.

## Comparing TFS' CI/CD with CircleCI

Rather than maintaining separate comparisons for our on-premises and cloud-hosted versions of Azure DevOps, please visit the [Azure Pipelines vs. CircleCI](Azure-Pipelines-vs-CircleCI.md) page to learn how the two products actually compare.  

If you'd like to compare specifically the CI/CD capabilities (i.e., automated build, testing, deplolyment and reporting) of TFS, you can look directly into the [Azure Pipelines comparison](Azure-Pipelines-vs-CircleCI.md#compare-circleci-with-azure-pipelines) (Azure Pipelines is the cloud-hosted counterpart to TFS' CI/CD capabilities).  You can also [compare the breadth of TFS capabilities](Azure-Pipelines-vs-CircleCI.md#compare-circleci-with-azure-devops) with CircleCI.
