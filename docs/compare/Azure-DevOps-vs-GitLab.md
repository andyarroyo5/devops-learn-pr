# Azure DevOps vs GitLab

> Note: Azure DevOps Services was previously named "Visual Studio Team Services" or VSTS.  The on-premise version is 
> named Azure DevOps Server 2019, formerly "Team Foundation Server" or TFS.  The following comparisons apply to VSTS vs GitLab 
> and Azure DevOps Server vs GitLab. We do not offer a separate TFS vs GitLab; it will be similar but may vary depending on the TFS version.

[Azure DevOps](https://azure.com/devops) services  provide enterprise-grade reliability, including a 99.9 percent SLA and 24×7 support, and new features every three weeks.  
These services include:
- [Azure Boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/boards) for agile management and reporting (comparison coming soon)
- [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos) - [Compare](\#repos) with GitLab for source control
- [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.com/pipelines) - [Compare](\#pipelines) with GitLab for automated build, test and deploy
- [Azure Artifacts](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/artifacts) for package management and binary reuse (comparison not yet available)
- [Azure Test Plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/test-plans) for manual test management and reporting (GitLab doesn't provide these capabilities)

Azure DevOps services support any language, any platform, and **even any cloud**. They are
streamlined and efficient to support small teams, but also enterprise-grade and
secure to support large organizations. But don’t take our word for it. [Try Azure
DevOps services](https://azure.com/devops) yourself – *for FREE*!

## Do you need extensibility?

Azure DevOps provides an open ecosystem, including a [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops) 
with over 600 community and commercial integrations. It offers a scalable, enterprise-grade Git
source control system with mature security, workflows and integrations. And with
a holistic vision of DevOps practices, you can create topic branches from your Kanban board,
gain deep insights to your process with cycle and lead time graphs, build custom
dashboards, and track the details of what is in an environment and how it got
there. But Azure DevOps also provides an open ecosystem that allows you to swap
in third-party and open source tools to suit your needs!

## Does money matter?

Of course it does! Azure DevOps offers competitive pricing whether you use all
DevOps services or just one. For example, a team of 10 users pays \$30/month for
agile tools, unlimited git repos, 30 hours of hosted CI/CD and more! GitLab’s
starter costs \$40/month with an annual commit for the same 10 users,
and it doesn’t include CI/CD. The [Azure DevOps pricing
page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/)
makes it easy to determine how little it will cost for your team to get the
DevOps tooling loved by developers and trusted by enterprises!

## Any language, any platform, **any cloud!**

You probably have a specific deployment target today. Avoid having to repeat
this exercise by making sure your choice meets your needs for today AND
tomorrow. Over 80K Microsoft employees use Azure DevOps to develop .NET, Java,
Node.JS and more, targeting Linux, Windows, macOS, containers, the cloud, iOS
and Android. And despite the name, you can target on-premises clouds, AWS, GCP,
mobile devices and more. So even if you’re not using Azure, you should try 
Azure DevOps services now to see how it can support your needs - today AND tomorrow!

## Compare for yourself

As you can see above, Azure DevOps provides compelling capabilities including
several not available in GitLab. But perhaps you’d like to prove it yourself? As
an open platform, Azure allows you to use not only our DevOps tools, but
virtually all common tools, including GitLab! Feel free to check out [GitLab
CE](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/bitnami.gitlab)
as you form your own opinion and decide which DevOps tools are best for your
environment.

For further changes to the comparison set, please check out the [GitLab feature set](https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/azure-devops-vs-gitlab.html) at GitLab.

## Are you still reading?

Doing your research is important, but one of the best ways for you to convince
yourself of the value of Azure DevOps is to try it! Five users, unlimited repos,
and one parallel job with up to 1,800 monthly minutes of Microsoft-hosted CI/CD
for FREE! [Try Azure DevOps services now](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/)!
