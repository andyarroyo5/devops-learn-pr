> By: Dave McKinstry

[Azure DevOps](https://azure.com/devops/) represents a collection of tools supporting DevOps practices.  Azure DevOps services provides enterprise-grade reliability, including a 99.9 percent SLA and 24Ã—7 support, and new features every three weeks.  Or you can manage your own secure, on-premises environment with Team Foundation Server. Get source code management, automated builds, requirements management, reporting, and more.

 Azure DevOps services include:
- [Azure Boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/boards/) - Deliver value to your users faster using proven agile tools to plan, track, and discuss work across your teams.
- [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos/) - Get unlimited, cloud-hosted private Git repos and collaborate to build better code with pull requests and advanced file management.
- [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/) - Build, test, and deploy with CI/CD that works with any language, platform, and cloud. Connect to GitHub or any other Git provider and deploy continuously.
- [Azure Artifacts](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/artifacts/) - Create, host, and share packages with your team, and add artifacts to your CI/CD pipelines with a single click.
- [Azure Test Plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/test-plans/) - Test and ship with confidence using manual and exploratory testing tools.

## Azure Pipelines vs CircleCI
CircleCI only provides a subset of these servcies.  Although it is fair to ask how Azure DevOps compares with CircleCI, it makes more sense to compare the services that CircleCI does offer...  CI/CD.  We have a [separate comparison page](./Azure-Pipelines-vs-CircleCI) which evaluates [Azure Pipelines against CircleCI](./Azure-Pipelines-vs-CircleCI#how-does-circleci-compare-with-azure-pipelines) and also [Azure DevOps services as a whole against CircleCI](./Azure-Pipelines-vs-CircleCI#how-does-circleci-compare-with-azure-devops).

Please visit the [Azure Pipelines vs. CircleCI](./Azure-Pipelines-vs-CircleCI) page to learn how the two products actually compare.
