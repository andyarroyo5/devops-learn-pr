# Azure Pipelines vs CircleCI

[Azure Pipelines](https://azure.com/pipelines/) is a powerful, open, and extensible platform for continuous
integration and delivery. Pipelines provides one free parallel job running on
macOS, Linux and/or Windows. And if your project is public, you get **unlimited**
build time with 10 parallel jobs! It is free and easy to [get
started](https://azure.com/pipelines/) â€“ give it
a try to experience how Azure Pipelines can streamline your release process!

## DevOps is more than CI/CD

Azure Pipelines was designed as a part of a secure
enterprise-grade end-to-end DevOps solution. Azure Pipelines supports not only
Linux and macOS, but also Windows. Azure Pipelines provides security, approval
processes, release gates, and a rich marketplace. And through Azure DevOps
services, Pipelines supports full traceability across the entire DevOps
lifecycle.

Azure DevOps services is a family of integrated tools offering unified user
experience and management. Like Pipelines, nearly all Azure DevOps services are
free for small teams and open source projects and allow you to get started
without manually integrating, configuring, securing, patching and licensing
tools from multiple vendors and community. With lifecycle
reporting, Azure DevOps allows you to summarize and roll-up your data on
dashboards and gain a holistic view of your world. But you can still use Azure
Pipelines with GitHub, Jenkins and your other favorite DevOps tools.

## Get more, pay less

CircleCI provides one free parallel job and up to 1,500 monthly build minutes for Linux and macOS.  Azure Pipelines not only offers more free minutes, but it also supports Windows as well.  And when you start paying, the difference gets bigger.  Azure Pipelines is 10% cheaper for each paid parallel job hosted by Microsoft or CircleCI.  And if you choose to host it yourself, Azure Pipelines is $15/month for each parallel job; CircleCI **starts** at $700/month and requires an annual contract.
