# VSTS vs CircleCI

> By: Dave McKinstry

Azure DevOps Services are the new version of  Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS).  Like VSTS, Azure DevOps Services provide enterprise-grade reliability, including a 99.9 percent SLA and 24Ã—7 support, and new features every three weeks.  Where VSTS contained a collection of services, Azure DevOps provides separate services which can be used together: [Azure Boards](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/boards/), [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos/), [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/), [Azure Artifacts](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/artifacts/), and [Azure Test Plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/test-plans/).

## Azure Pipelines vs CircleCI

CircleCI only provides a subset of the Azure DevOps servcies.  Although it is fair to ask how Azure DevOps compares with CircleCI, it makes more sense to compare the service that CircleCI does offer...  CI/CD.  We have a [separate comparison page](./Azure-Pipelines-vs-CircleCI) which evaluates [Azure Pipelines against CircleCI](./Azure-Pipelines-vs-CircleCI#compare-circleci-with-azure-pipelines) and also [Azure DevOps services as a whole against CircleCI](./Azure-Pipelines-vs-CircleCI#compare-circleci-with-azure-devops).

Please visit the [Azure Pipelines vs. CircleCI](./Azure-Pipelines-vs-CircleCI) page to learn how the two products actually compare.
