# What is DevOps Culture?

DevOps culture stresses small, multidisciplinary teams, who work
autonomously and take collective accountability for how actual users
experience their software. For a DevOps team, *there’s no place like
production.* Everything they do is about making customers’ live
experience better.

DevOps teams apply agile practices and include operations in the team
responsibility. Teams work in small batches, focus on improving the
end-to-end delivery of customer value, and strive to eliminate waste and
impediments along the way. There are no silos and no blame game, because
the team is mutually accountable.

DevOps teams apply a *growth mindset*. They make beliefs explicit,
hypothesize impact to create better results, and implement the
hypotheses as experiments. DevOps teams use monitoring and telemetry to
gather evidence in production and observe results in real time. When
evidence diminishes hypotheses, the experiences become opportunities to
*fail fast* or gather validated learning quickly from the experiment.
When evidence supports hypotheses, the team uses the opportunity to
persevere, or double down, on the actions that lead to improvement.

In transitioning to DevOps, teams shift their priority from optimizing
mean time between failure (MTBF) to mean time to mitigate (MTTM) and
mean time to remediate (MTTR). Unlike in the past, when lengthy
processes were designed to prevent changes that might lead to problems
in the field, DevOps teams stress being able to move fast, understand
the impact and react quickly.

DevOps teams think in terms of competencies, not roles. While they
include both developmental and operational skills and awareness, they
share responsibility for running the live site.  That means that
developers on the team accept responsibility for the health of the
running services and will rotate time on-call. The principle is, if you
build it, you run it.
