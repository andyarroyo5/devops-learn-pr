## Overview
The “Microsoft Universal Store Team” (UST) is the main commercial engine
of Microsoft with the mission to bring One Universal Store for all
commerce at Microsoft. The UST encompasses everything Microsoft sells
and everything others sell through the company, consumer and commercial,
digital and physical, subscription and transaction, via all channels and
storefronts.
To achieve the objective of one Universal Store, UST had to bring
together multiple teams from across Microsoft with different engineering
systems, engineering culture, and processes into one streamlined
delivery cadence catering to cost, agility and quality needs of the
business.
**Continuous Delivery** is a key part of the UST transformation. Visual
Studio Team Services (VSTS) in the Microsoft One Engineering System
(1ES) made continuous delivery practical for the UST. This case study
provides an overview of the approach, the challenges and the process
adopted to help achieve the objective.
## DevOps Improvements at a Glance
The UST piloted VSTS in December 2015 through Feb 2016 and went into
production in March 2016. The fastest way to see the changes is to
contrast a few key metrics, showing improvement of 40x to 8000x year
over
year.
